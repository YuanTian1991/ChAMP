Title: Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline for Illumina
        HumanMethylation450
Version: 1.5.7
Date: 2015-04-13
Description: The package includes quality control metrics, a selection
        of normalization methods and novel methods to identify
        differentially methylated regions and to highlight copy number
        aberrations. In addition their is a method to help calculate hmC using BS and oxBS samples.
